# ADON Parser

This is a parser generated by PEG.js for my custom object notation syntax. 

```sh
npm install adon
```


## Motivation

My notation is a bit lighter on quotes than JSON and in a millennium first (sarcasm) accepts identifiers with whitespace between each word.

## Examples

These are some examples of the syntax (no real world use cases, just examples).

```javascript

Config = {

    Title = "This is an example of the syntax"
    Port = 8080

    Routes = [
        {
            Pattern = "/"
            File = "/src/index.html"
        }
        {
            Pattern = "/about"
            File = "/src/about.html"
        }
    ]

    Another List [
        1, 2, 3
        4, 5,
        6
        7
        { 
            First Prop = 12 kg
        }
    ]

    Proposition1   1 1.0 = "This works"

    Front End Framework = React JS
    Back End Framework = Express JS

}

```

## Syntax Definition

**TODO:** For now see the [grammar](./grammar.pegjs) file.

# ADON Parser

This is a parser generated by PEG.js for my custom object notation syntax. 

## Motivation

My notation is a bit lighter on quotes than JSON and in a millennium first (sarcasm) accepts identifiers with whitespace between each word (but no numbers are allowed for now).

## Examples

```javascript

Config {

    Title = "This is an example of the syntax"
    Port = 8080

    Routes = [
        {
            Pattern = "/"
            File = "/src/index.html"
        }
        {
            Pattern = "/about"
            File = "/src/about.html"
        }
    ]

    Another List [
        1, 2, 3
        4, 5,
        6
        7
        { First Prop = 12.0 }
    ]

    Front End Framework = React JS
    Back End Framework = Express JS

}

```
